### About Shoreline
The Shoreline platform provides real-time monitoring, alerting, and incident automation for cloud operations. Use Shoreline to detect, debug, and automate repairs across your entire fleet in seconds with just a few lines of code.

Shoreline Agents are efficient and non-intrusive processes running in the background of all your monitored hosts. Agents act as the secure link between Shoreline and your environment's Resources, providing real-time monitoring and metric collection across your fleet. Agents can execute actions on your behalf -- everything from simple Linux commands to full remediation playbooks -- running simultaneously across all the targeted Resources.

Since Agents are distributed throughout your fleet and monitor your Resources in real time, when an issue occurs Shoreline automatically alerts your team before your operators notice something is wrong. Plus, when you're ready for it, Shoreline can automatically resolve these issues using Alarms, Actions, Bots, and other Shoreline tools that you configure. These objects work in tandem to monitor your fleet and dispatch the appropriate response if something goes wrong -- you can even receive notifications via the fully-customizable Slack integration.

Shoreline Notebooks let you convert your static runbooks into interactive, annotated, sharable web-based documents. Through a combination of Markdown-based notes and Shoreline's expressive Op language, you have one-click access to real-time, per-second debug data and powerful, fleetwide repair commands.

### What are Shoreline Op Packs?
Shoreline Op Packs are open-source collections of Terraform configurations and supporting scripts that use the Shoreline Terraform Provider and the Shoreline Platform to create turnkey incident automations for common operational issues. Each Op Pack comes with smart defaults and works out of the box with minimal setup, while also providing you and your team with the flexibility to customize, automate, codify, and commit your own Op Pack configurations.

# Duplicate Entry Error in Istio Pilot
---

This incident type involves a duplicate entry error in Istio Pilot, which may result in issues with the service it is providing. The error message usually contains information about the instance and labels involved in the error. It is important to investigate and resolve this issue promptly to prevent any further disruptions.

### Parameters
```shell
export NAMESPACE="PLACEHOLDER"

export POD_NAME="PLACEHOLDER"

export ENTRY="PLACEHOLDER"

export YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME="PLACEHOLDER"

export YOUR_LOG_FILE_PATH="PLACEHOLDER"

export ISTIO_PILOT_APP_LABEL="PLACEHOLDER"

export ISTIO_PILOT_DEPLOYMENT_NAME="PLACEHOLDER"
```

## Debug

### Find the Istio Pilot pods running
```shell
kubectl get pods -n ${NAMESPACE} -l app=istio-pilot
```

### Get logs from the Istio Pilot pod
```shell
kubectl logs ${POD_NAME} -n ${NAMESPACE} istio-proxy
```

### Check the Istio Pilot configuration file
```shell
kubectl exec -it ${POD_NAME} -n ${NAMESPACE} -- cat /etc/istio/proxy/envoy-rev0.json
```

### Check the Istio Pilot configuration file for duplicate entries
```shell
kubectl exec -it ${POD_NAME} -n ${NAMESPACE} -- cat /etc/istio/proxy/envoy-rev0.json | grep -c ${ENTRY}
```

### Check the Istio Pilot configuration file for all entries
```shell
kubectl exec -it ${POD_NAME} -n ${NAMESPACE} -- cat /etc/istio/proxy/envoy-rev0.json | grep ${ENTRY}
```

### Configuration errors: The duplicate entry error may occur if there are configuration errors in the instance or labels of Istio Pilot. This could happen due to a misconfiguration while setting up Istio Pilot or changes made to the configuration by mistake.
```shell
bash

#!/bin/bash



# Set variables

NAMESPACE=${NAMESPACE}

POD_NAME=${POD_NAME}

CONTAINER_NAME=${YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME}

LOG_FILE=${YOUR_LOG_FILE_PATH}



# Get logs from the Istio Pilot container

kubectl logs -n $NAMESPACE $POD_NAME -c $CONTAINER_NAME > $LOG_FILE 2>&1



# Check if the log file contains any configuration errors

if grep -q "configuration error" $LOG_FILE; then

  echo "Configuration error detected in Istio Pilot logs."

  echo "Please check the configuration settings for Istio Pilot."

else

  echo "No configuration errors detected in Istio Pilot logs."

fi


```

## Repair

### Restart the Istio Pilot service to see if that resolves the issue. If not, attempt to roll back to a previous version of the service that was working correctly.
```shell


#!/bin/bash



# Restart Istio Pilot service

kubectl rollout restart deployment/${ISTIO_PILOT_DEPLOYMENT_NAME}



# Wait for the service to restart

echo "Waiting for Istio Pilot service to restart..."

sleep 20



# Check if the service is running

if kubectl get pods -l app=${ISTIO_PILOT_APP_LABEL} | grep Running; then

    echo "Istio Pilot service restarted successfully!"

else

    echo "Failed to restart Istio Pilot service. Rolling back to previous version..."



    # Rollback to previous version

    kubectl rollout undo deployment/${ISTIO_PILOT_DEPLOYMENT_NAME}



    # Wait for the service to roll back

    echo "Waiting for Istio Pilot service to roll back..."

    sleep 20



    # Check if the service is running

    if kubectl get pods -l app=${ISTIO_PILOT_APP_LABEL} | grep Running; then

        echo "Istio Pilot service rolled back successfully!"

    else

        echo "Failed to roll back Istio Pilot service. Please investigate further."
